        Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. (Stock Symbol DMI) is a fictional
        paper company in the television series The Office. The Scranton,
        Pennsylvania Branch of Dunder Mifflin serves as the main setting for the
        series. The company was founded by Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin in
        1949, where they supplied metal brackets. Eventually, the company
        started selling paper and opened several branches across the
        Northeastern United States. In 2009, the company went bankrupt, and was
        bought by printer company Sabre. In 2012, Sabre was dissolved and the
        company became Dunder Mifflin once again.
