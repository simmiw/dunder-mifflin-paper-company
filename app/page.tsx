          Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. is a fictional paper and office
          supplies wholesale company featured in the American television series
          The Office. It is analogous to Wernham Hogg in the British original of
          the series, and Papiers Jennings and Cogirep in the French Canadian
          and French adaptations, respectively. Originally, the company was
          completely fictitious, but eventually, the brand was used to sell
          products at Staples and other office supply outlets.
